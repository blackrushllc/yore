# YoBASIC - An extendable BASIC programming language for Yore
+ Requires database to use DB functions
+ Includes a help library
+ Extends Yore API to provide BASIC driven API output
  + Or execution of YoBASIC code via API
  + Or whatever fun stuff I can think of
+ Designed to be easily extended by other Yore Modules like Twilite
+ Designed to be able to remotely execute code from other modules like YoreGames
+ Includes an admin dashboard for editing and debugging code
+ Allows you to declare, create, extend, intercept and override Ph@t functions

+ Make each function in the language be a class or a class which contains a set of functions (somehow)
+ Be able to declare routes to BASIC routines
+ Make the interpreter a class which can be instantiated for subs and functions
+ Allow subs or functions to be "status", that is, when called repeatedly, theh same one is used with existing variables
+ ^ Or even be stateless or something

+ Allow Modules to extend the language (like Database adding DB commands, or Users having auth functions)
