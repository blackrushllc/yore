To replicate the functionality of Laravel's PHP command line tool in your own framework, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Create a Command Line Script**
- Start by creating a PHP script that serves as the entry point for your command line tool. This script will instantiate necessary classes and set up your environment.

   ```php
   // cli.php
   <?php

   // Include your framework's autoload or bootstrap file
   require 'bootstrap.php';

   // Set up your framework's environment
   // e.g., load configuration, initialize services, etc.

   // Start a PHP shell
   $prompt = "MyFramework> ";
   while (true) {
       $input = readline($prompt);
       if ($input === 'exit') {
           break;
       }

       try {
           eval($input);
       } catch (Throwable $e) {
           echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
       }
   }
   ```

### 2. **Bootstrap Your Framework**
- In your `bootstrap.php` file (or equivalent), load all necessary classes, configurations, and services that your framework needs. This will ensure that when you enter the command prompt, all your framework's features are readily available.

   ```php
   // bootstrap.php
   <?php

   // Autoload classes
   spl_autoload_register(function ($class) {
       include __DIR__ . '/src/' . str_replace('\\', '/', $class) . '.php';
   });

   // Load configuration
   $config = require 'config.php';

   // Initialize services (e.g., database, cache, etc.)
   $db = new \MyFramework\Database($config['db']);
   $cache = new \MyFramework\Cache($config['cache']);

   // Make these available globally
   global $db, $cache;

   ```

### 3. **Run Your Command Line Tool**
- Open a terminal and run the script.

   ```bash
   php cli.php
   ```

This will open a command prompt (`MyFramework>`). Here, you can execute PHP commands, and all your framework's classes and services will be accessible.

### 4. **Enhance the Experience**
- You can further enhance this tool by adding command history, autocompletion, or even integrating with your framework's command system if you have one.

### Example of Use:
```php
MyFramework> $user = new \MyFramework\Models\User();
MyFramework> $user->find(1);
MyFramework> print_r($user);
```

This setup will give you a basic REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) where you can interact with your framework in a similar way to Laravel's `tinker` tool.
